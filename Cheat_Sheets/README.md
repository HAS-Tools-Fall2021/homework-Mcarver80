Use this folder to submit your cheat sheets for grading

#Grades:
1. GitHub: 8/10!  Really nice job I love your graphical representation. Just a few notes:
- make sure you have a heading with your name and the assignment.
- Your words at the top are a little hard to follow maybe you can organize these a bit more clearly by topic? Like maybe definitions in one group and actions (pull, push etc). In another.
- A repository -- Is a folder that has version control (i.e. track changes) it can be either remote or local.
-  In your drawing its not clear to me what the difference is between remote and GitHub -- in our case all of our remote repositories live on GitHub in the cloud. So these could be the same thing.
