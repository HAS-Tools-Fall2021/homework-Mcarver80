I chose my predictions for this week based on the flow data from the years 2018-present. I also used the rain predictions to make my estimate.

**1.	Describe the variables flow, year, month, and day. What type of objects are they? What data types are they composed of? How long are they?**
Flow is a measurement of the volume of fluid. The flow can be measured in cubic feet per second (cfs), cubic meters per second (cms), or gallons per minute (gpm). Flow, year, month, and day are lists. They are composed of flow data from 1989-2021 up to the month of September.

**2.	How many times was the daily flow greater than your prediction in the month of September (express your answer in terms of the total number of times and as a percentage)?**
Week 1 – 125 = 45.5%   130 = 42.4%
Week 2 – 147 = 33.5%   156 = 30.7%

**3.	How would your answer to the previous question change if you considered only daily flows in or before 2000? Same question for the flows in or after the year 2010? (again report total number of times and percentage)**
Week 1 (2000) – 125 = 22.8%   130 = 21.6%
Week 2 (2000) – 147 = 17.5%   156 = 16.5%
Week 1 (2010) – 125 = 16.5%   130 = 30%
Week 2 (2010) – 147 = 24.4%  156 = 23%

**4.	How does the daily flow generally change from the first half of September to the second?**
The daily flow changes by an increase of 480.
