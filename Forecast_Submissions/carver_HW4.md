**1.	Provide a summary of the forecast values you picked and why. Include discussion of the quantitative analysis that led to your prediction. This can include any analysis you complete but must include at least two histograms and some quantitative discussion of flow quantiles that helped you make your decision.**
My estimate for this week’s streamflow gauge was based on current weather forecasts and the data from 2020, 2019, and 2018. 

**2.	Describe the variable flow_data:**
**•	What is it?** 
- nparray
**•	What type of values it is composed of?** 
- It includes flow data for years, months, and days. 
**•	What is are its dimensions, and total size?** 
- There is a row for each day and there are 4 columns of data.

**3.	How many times was the daily flow greater than your prediction in the month of September (express your answer in terms of the total number of times and as a percentage)?**
Week 1: 115 = 251.59
Week 2: 97 = 223.95

**4.	How would your answer to the previous question change if you considered only daily flows in or before 2000? Same question for the flows in or after the year 2010? (again report total number of times and percentage)**
Week 1 (2000): 115 =
Week 2 (2000): 97 =
Week 1 (2010): 115 =
Week 2 (2010): 97 = 

**5.	How does the daily flow generally change from the first half of September to the second?**
